# Running dude
Running Dude is a simple game built using Pygame, a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. This project serves as a beginner-friendly example of game development using Python and Pygame.

## Game Overview
In Running Dude, the player controls a character (the "dude") who must navigate through obstacles. The game demonstrates fundamental concepts of game development, including player input, collision detection,and basic graphics.

## Features
- Player control with keyboard input.
- Obstacle avoidance and scoring mechanics.
- Basic game graphics and animation.
- Responsive game window.

## What I Learned
In the process of creating Running Dude, I gained insights into several key aspects of Pygame and Python game development:
- Pygame Basics: I learned the fundamental concepts of Pygame, including initializing a game window, handling events, and managing game loops.

- Player Input Handling: Understanding how to capture and respond to player input from the keyboard, allowing the player to control the character.

- Collision Detection: Implementing collision detection to determine when the player character collides with obstacles or collects points.

- Game Graphics: Working with simple game graphics, including loading images, creating sprites, and updating the display.
